# primeFactorization
Project from Bootcamp. I made a small prime factorization calculator with CSS &amp; HTML inputs.

There are notes within the script file, but I will give a quick summary. This is a prime factorization calculator which takes a number and returns what prime numbers can go into said number each iteration.
